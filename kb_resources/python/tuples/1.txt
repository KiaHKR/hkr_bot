__**Tuples:**__

**Creating tuples**
You create a new tuple by writing : 
`tuplename = ()`

When creating a tuple, you can add items to it upon creating it.
`tuplename = ("item1", "item2", "item3")`

A tuple is iterable meaning each element in the tuple can be adressed individually.
```Python
Example: 
	shopping_tuple = ("apples", "bananas", "cherries")
```

**Adressing a specific item in a tuple**
You can address a specific item in the tuple by using indexes.
While you might think the first element in a tuple has index 1, the indexing itself always starts at 0.
To address the first element in your tuple, you address your tuple and then provide it the index of the item.
`tuple[0]`

```Python
Example: 
	shopping_tuple = ("apples", "bananas", "cherries")
	print(shopping_tuple[1])
```
This will output the item at index 1 : "bananas"
Since indexing starts at 0, "apples" would be 0 and "bananas" in this case is 1.	

**Adding to a tuple**

You can't add items to a tuple once it has been created.
Compared to lists, tuples run faster but are immutable.


**Removing from a tuple**

You can't remove items from a tuple once it has been created.
Compared to lists, tuples run faster but are immutable.
