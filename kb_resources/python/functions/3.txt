**Passing a variable to a function**
We will now reuse the previous code, but instead, pass a variable to the code to run.
A function can not use a variable that is anywhere in the code unless you pass it in the brackets of the function.
```Python
Example: 
def print_hello(name):
	print(f'User {name} identified.')
	print(f"Hello and welcome to this example program, {name}.")
	print("This program will show you how to use functions.")
	print("You will find that functions allow for much cleaner and easier code as you continue your studies.")

name = input("What is your name?: ")
print_hello(name)
name2 = input("What is the second users name?: ")
print_hello(name2)

```
Output to the console : 
	What is your name?: Tom
	User Tom identified.
	Hello and welcome to this example program, Tom. 
	This program will show you how to use functions.
	You will find that functions allow for much cleaner and easier code as you continue your studies.
	What is the second users name?: Lasse
	User Lasse identified.
	Hello and welcome to this example program, Lasse.
	This program will show you how to use functions.
	You will find that functions allow for much cleaner and easier code as you continue your studies.
