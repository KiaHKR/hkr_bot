**Returning a variable from a function**
A function can be used to perform actions and operation and then return a value to where it was called.
In this idea, you can for example program a function to perform mathematical operations and execute them with any input.

When we create a function that has a return value, we NEED TO store it in a variable where the function was called!!
```Python
Structure :
	def function1(variable):
		variable2 = code/operation to execute
		return variable2

	variable = input("")
	variable3 = function1(variable)

 ---------------------------
 
Example: 
	def addition(value1, value2):
		sum = value1 + value2
		return sum

	print("Welcome to the addition calculator.")
	number1 = int(input("Please enter the first number"))
	number2 = int(input("Please enter the second number"))

	total = addition(value1, value2)
	print(total)

```
