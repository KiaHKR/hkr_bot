__**Functions:**__

**Explanation**
Python reads and runs code from line to line, even the code it read does not need to be used.
This can increase the runtime for programs significantly.
To solve this issue and to keep the code cleaner, we use functions.
To create a function, you write def functionName(): and follow with the code to execute
```Python
Example: 
    def printIntro():
    print("Hello World")

```
**In practice**
Based on the previous example, if we now type "printInto()" in our code, it will run everything in that method.
In this case, it will print "Hello World" and return to the main code.

We can develop this further by having code before and after the function call.
```Python

Example:
	def print_hello():
		print("Hello and welcome to this example program.")
		print("This program will show you how to use functions.")
		print("You will find that functions allow for much cleaner and easier code as you continue your studies.")

	name = input("What is your name?: ")
	print(f'User {name} identified.')
	print_hello()    
```
Output to the console : 
   What is your name?: Tom
    User Tom identified.
    Hello and welcome to this example program.
    This program will show you how to use functions.
    You will find that functions allow for much cleaner and easier code as you continue your studies.
