__**For loops:**__

**Basic for loop**

A for loop is a specific loop that is used to iterate (or cycle) through an iterable (String, List, Tuple,..)
A for loop will address each element in the iterable once and then execute the code written in the loop.
When starting this loop you give the individual element a variable name (to address it) and give it the iterable element.
```
for element_variable_name in iterable: #iterable being a list, string or similar code to execute
```
```Python
Example: 
    order1 = ["kebab", 5,]
    order2 = ["good bread", 3]
    order3 = ["candy", 4]
    order_list = [order1, order2, order3]

    for orders in order_list:
        print(orders[0])
```
This will output the String of the item name in each order like follows: 
```
"kebab"
"good bread"
"candy"
```


**Nesting for loops**
Nesting loops within each other is possible with all kinds of loops.
In this case, you can create a for loop in a for loop when multiple iterables exist together.

```
for variable1 in list1:
    for variable2 in list2:
        code to execute
    code to execute
```
```Python
Example: 
	order1 = ["kebab", 5,]
	order2 = ["good bread", 3]
	order3 = ["candy", 4]
	order_list = [order1, order2, order3]

for order in order_list:
    for details in order:
        print(details)
```
This will first loop through each sublist.
Then, when it addresses a sublist, it will address each element in the sublist and output it : 
```
kebab
5
good bread
3
candy
4

```
