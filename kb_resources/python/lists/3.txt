__**Negative indexing**__
You can access a list starting from the end by indexing with negatives.
`list[-1]`

```Python
Example: 
    
	shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "cherries"]
	print(shopping_list[-1])

```
This will output the first item from the end of the list : "cherries"

**List slicing**
You can address multiple items in a list by using slicing.
While using this method, you give your code a certain range in your list of the element you would like to access in form of indexes.
The last item in this range is NOT included.
```Python
list[0:2]
list[2:4]
list[5:7]
```

```Python
Example: 
    
	shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "cherries", "coconut", "good bread"]
	print(shopping_list[0:2])
```
This will output the items of the index in range 0 to 2 with the index2 excluded : ["apples", "bananas"]
```Python
	print(shopping_list[3:4])
```
This will output the items of the index in range 3 to 4 with the index4 excluded : ["coconut"]



**Merging lists**
```
You can merge lists into one by using the .extend() method.

list1.extend(list2)

 ---------------------------
Example: 
        coop = ["bananas", "apples", "good bread"]
	ica = ["sausages", "steak", "chicken"]
	coop.extend(ica)
	print(coop)

	This will output the merged lists in the variable coop : 
	["bananas", "apples", "good bread", "sausages", "steak", "chicken"]

```
