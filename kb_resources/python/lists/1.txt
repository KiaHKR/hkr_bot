__**Lists:**__

**Creating list**
You create a new list by writing : 
`listname = []`
When creatng a list, you can add items to it upon creating it.
`listname = ["item1", "item2", "item3"]`

A list is iterable meaning each element in the list can be adressed individually.
```Python
Example: 
    
	shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "cherries"]

```

**Adressing a specific item in a list**
You can address a specific item in the list by using indexes.
While you might think the first element in a list has index 1, the indexing itself always starts at 0.
To address the first element in your list, you address your list and then provide it the index of the item.

`list[0]`

```Python
Example: 
    
	shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "cherries"]
	print(shopping_list[1])
```
	This will output the item at index 1 : "bananas"
	Since indexing starts at 0, "apples" would be 0 and "bananas" in this case is 1.	

**Adding to a list**
You can add items to a list by using the list.append() method.
`list.append(item)`
```Python
Example: 
    
	shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "cherries"]
	shopping_list.append("coconut")
	print(shopping_list)
```
	This will output the updated list : ["apples", "bananas", "cherries", "coconut"]
