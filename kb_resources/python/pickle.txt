__**Pickle**__

**Using pickle**
```
In order to use any pickle methods, we first need to import pickle at the beginning of the file.

 ---------------------------
Example: 

import pickle

code to exectue

```

**Pickling a file**
Once pickle has been imported, we can use it to pickle or unpickle files.
To pickle a file, we use the method called pickle.dump(data_to_pickle, output_file)
When using pickle, we use "wb" for write mode and "rb" for read mode when opening a file
`rb` = read binary, `wb` = write binary
Once we are done pickling a file, we need to remember to close it.


```Python
Example:
    import pickle

    user_ids = ["jke12", "kdaiq2", "asdlr"]
    file_name = input("Enter the file you want to pickle: ")
    opened_file = open(file_name, "wb")
    pickle.dump(user_ids, opened_file)
    opened_file.close()
```

**Unpickling a file**
In order to unpickle a file, we use the method called pickle.load()
```Python
Example: 

import pickle

user_ids = ["jke12", "kdaiq2", "asdlr"]
file_name = input("Enter the file you want to unpickle: ")
opened_file = open(file_name, "wb")
pickle.load(opened_file)
opened_file.close()
```
