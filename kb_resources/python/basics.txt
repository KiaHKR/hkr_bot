__**Basics for Python :**__

**String to variable**

`VariableName = "Name"`
Assigns the string 'Name' to a variable.

**Integer to variable**

`variable_name = 2`
Assigns the Integer '2' to a variable


**Boolean value in variable**

`variableName = True `
Assigns the Boolean value True (or 1) to a variable
In Boolean value, True and 1 are considered to be the same.
The same applies to False and 0.

**Print**

print() 
Prints the contents in the brackets.
 
```Python
Example: 
    print("Hello World")
``` 
This prints "Hello World" to the console.


**Print with a variable**

`print(variable1)`
Prints the variable1's contents to the console.
```Python
Example:
    variable1 = "Hello World" 
    print(variable1)
```
This prints "Hello World" to the console.

**Print f String**

`print(f"Hello {variable1}")`
Prints the contents in the brackets including the variable's contents.

```Python
Example: 
    name = "Lasse"
    age = "26"
    print("Hello {name}. You are {age} years old.")
    
``` 
This prints "Hello Lasse. You are 26 years old." to the console.

**Input**
`variableName = input(‘Enter content’)`
Assigns the content of the input as a String to a variable.

**Math with variables**

You can do math with variables of the same type (Integer, float, ...)
`variable3 = variable1 x variable2`
```Python
Example: 
    variable1 = 2
    variable2 = 5
    variable3 = variable1 x variable2

```

This will perform 2x5 and assign it to the variable3
