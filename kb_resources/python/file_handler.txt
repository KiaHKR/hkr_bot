__**File Handler**__

**Reading file**
Python has built-in features that allow for file reading.
First, a file needs to be opened with the open(file_name, read/write) method.
Then, if writing mode is selected, we can use the write(content) method to write content into the file.
Finally, we use the close() method to close the file.
To read, the mode is defined by r.
To write, the mode is defined by w.

```Python
variable1 = open("file.txt", "r")
variable1.write("content")
variable1.close()
```

Example modified from Canvas:
```Python
first_number = input("Enter the first number: ")
second_number = input("Enter the second number: ")

numbers_file = open('numbers.txt', 'w')
numbers_file.write(str(first_number) + '\n')
numbers_file.write(str(second_number) + '\n')
numbers_file.close()
```
