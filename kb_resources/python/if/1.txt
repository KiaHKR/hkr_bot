__**If statements :**__

**Basic if**
If statements are snippets of code that are executed IF a given condition is met. 
```Python

Structure : 
	if condition1 = True:
		code to execute
	---------------------------
	Example: 
		love = True
		if love == True:
			print("Love is in the air")

```
This prints "Love is in the air" to the console.

**If else**
If statements can also have an else attached to it which will be executed if the condition is not met.
```Python
Structure : 
	if condition1 == True:
		code to execute
	else:
		code to execute (if not True)
	---------------------------
	Example: 
		love = True
		if love == True:
			print("Love is in the air")
		else:
			print("What is love?")

```
This prints "Love is in the air" to the console.

**Nested if**
If statements can also be nested to have multiple if statements.
```Python
Structure : 
	if condition1 == True
		if condition2 == True
			code to execute (If both are true)
		else:
			code to execute (if c1 is true and c2 is false)
  	  else:
		code to execute (if c1 is false)
 ---------------------------
Example: 
	allergy = ‘Fish’
	lunch = ‘Beef’
	dinner = ‘Fish’
		if lunch != allergy:
			if dinner != allergy:
				Print(‘We’ll have lunch and dinner!’)
			else:
				Print(‘We’ll only have lunch!’)
		else:
			Print(‘Sorry we’ll have to skip!’)

```
