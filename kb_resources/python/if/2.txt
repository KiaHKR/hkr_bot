**if elif**
Sometimes if statements can have multiple if-else's in the strcture. 
```Python

Structure : 
	if condition1 == True:
		code to execute
	else:
		if condition2 == True:
			code to execute
		else: 
			if condition3 == True:
				code to execute
			else:
				code to execute

```
This structure is NOT efficient and clean and can be improved by using elif instead of else:   if:
```Python
if condition1 == True:
	code to execute
elif condition2 == True:
	code to execute
elif condition3 == True:
	code to execute

```
This structure is much cleaner, easier to read and runs much faster.
