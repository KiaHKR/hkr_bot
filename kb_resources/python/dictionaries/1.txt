__**Dictionaries**__

**Dictionaries basics**
Dictionaries are used to store data values in pairs.
They are stored in the formed of key:value.
key being one data and value being another.
Like sets, dicitionairires do not allow duplicates.
You can create a dictionairy by using the following format: 
`dictionary = {key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3}`

```Python
Example: 
	user_pw_dict = { "lasse12":"igbiwoj32",
			"tom2144":"wekeqonf2",
			"kia9312":"jqjqi2h33",
			}

```

**Looking up in a dictionary**
In order to look something up in a dictionary, we write the dictionary name followed by square brackets that contain a key.

`dictionary_1["key"]`

```Python
Example: 
	user_pw_dict = { "lasse12":"igbiwoj32",
			"tom2144":"wekeqonf2",
			"kia9312":"jqjqi2h33",
			}

	print(user_pw_dict["tom2144"])
```
This will output the following:
`wekeqonf2`
