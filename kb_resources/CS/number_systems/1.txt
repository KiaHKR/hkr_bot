**Binary:**

*Basics*
```
Binary numbers are written with 0s and/or 1s.

When reading binary numbers, you usually start from right to left.
The left most number is either a 0 or a 1.
From there, each step you take to the left, you multiple the 1 by 2.
When multiple values in the binary numbers contain a 1, you need take the sum of all the numbers.

 ---------------------------
Example: 
    Binary 0 = Decimal 0
    Binary 1 = Decimal 1
    Binary 10 = Decimal 2
    Binary 100 = Decimal 4

    Binary 1010 = Decimal 2 + 8 = 10
